## 🚀 Getting Started

This project is a client-side only application and does not require a complex build process.

1.  **Environment Variable**: This application requires a Google Gemini API key. It must be available as an environment variable named `API_KEY`. The execution environment (e.g., an online IDE or a server setup) must inject this variable.

2.  **Serve the files**: Use any simple local web server to serve the `index.html` file. A popular choice is the `serve` package:
    ```bash
    # Install serve globally (if you haven't already)
    npm install -g serve

    # Serve the project directory
    serve .
    ```

3.  **Open in Browser**: Navigate to the local address provided by the server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
